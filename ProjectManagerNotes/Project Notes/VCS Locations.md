#Git repositories aren't only for cloned projects from GitHub. As a recent graduate of an Honours Bachelor of Science with High Distinction degree from the University of Toronto Mississauga (prev. Erindale), almost all of my experience with git has been cloning from GitHub or a repository hosted by the school, and repeating 
``` 
> git add --all
> git commit -m "Wow more code"
> git push 
```
and
```
> git pull
```
and more frustratingly,
```
> git pull
> git merge
> vim ./fubar_file1.java
> vim ./fubar_file2.java
> vim ./fubar_file3.java
> vim ./fubar_file4.java
> git status
> git commit -m "fixed your screw up guys. not impressed"
> git push
```
