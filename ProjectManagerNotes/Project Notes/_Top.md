Created by: Keith Allatt | https://github.com/keithallatt | June 2022

### Goal

There are a variety of [[Interaction Methods]].

[[Project Tracking]] allows for milestone planning over time; assigning severity to different milestone targets.

### Git Interaction
#Git is very useful for working in teams, and turns a lightweight database API into a verifiable project manager. 

## Project Status
####  *The Good*
- The program has a nice-enough looking GUI that runs at a passable FPS
#### *The Bad*
- Many interactions with the projects database is done through each script, not through the GUI or command line
- Many additions tank the FPS, and many aesthetic features had to be cut
