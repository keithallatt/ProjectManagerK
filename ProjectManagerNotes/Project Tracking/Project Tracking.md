# Project Tracking

[[Git Integration]] allows for logs of past commits, allowing for tracking of progress.

A more meaningful way of marking progress is through the use of [[Milestones]]. For small projects, this may be a Start & End case, but for large projects spread out over months, keeping on track will be paramount.


##### More Pages
- [[Database Operations]]
	- CRUD operations
- [[Project Validation On Load]]
	- Check that the file path exists, and that the name is valid, etc.
		- If the file path does not exist, ask to locate it, if no file path provided, then remove project from database
